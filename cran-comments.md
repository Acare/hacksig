## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. Package was archived on 2025-04-19 as issues were not corrected despite reminders.

In this version I have:

* Added new signatures to the package;
* Fixed vignette-building bugs related to new versions of suggested packages
* Updated CITATION with `bibentry()`
