\usage{
hack_immunophenoscore(expr_data, extract = "ips")
}
\arguments{
\item{expr_data}{A normalized gene expression matrix (or data frame) with
gene symbols as row names and samples as columns.}

\item{extract}{A string controlling which type of biomarker scores you want
to obtain. Possible choices are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"ips"} (default), only raw and discrete IPS scores;
\item \code{"class"}, IPS scores together with the four summary class scores;
\item \code{"all"}, all possible biomarker scores.
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row for each sample in \code{expr_data}, a column \code{sample_id}
indicating sample identifiers and a number of additional columns depending
on the choice of \code{extract}.
}
\description{
Obtain various immune biomarkers scores, which combined together give the
immunophenoscore (\emph{Charoentong et al., 2017}).
}
\details{
The immunophenoscore is conceived as a quantification of tumor immunogenicity.
It is obtained by aggregating multiple immune biomarkers scores, which are
grouped into four major classes:
\itemize{
\item \emph{MHC molecules} (\strong{MHC}), expression of MHC class I, class II, and non-classical molecules;
\item \emph{Immunomodulators} (\strong{CP}), expression of certain co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory molecules;
\item \emph{Effector cells} (\strong{EC}), infiltration of activated CD8+/CD4+ T cells and Tem (effector memory) CD8+/CD4+ cells;
\item \emph{Suppressor cells} (\strong{SC}), infiltration of immunosuppressive cells (Tregs and MDSCs).
}

The table below shows in detail the 26 immune biomarkers and cell types grouped
by class together with the number of genes which represent them:\tabular{lcc}{

\section{Algorithm}{

Samplewise gene expression z-scores are obtained for each of 26 immune cell
types and biomarkers. Then, weighted averaged z-scores are computed for each
class and the raw immunophenoscore (\eqn{IPS-raw}) results as the sum of the
four class scores. Finally, the immunophenoscore (\eqn{IPS}) is given as an
integer value between 0 and 10 in the following way:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{IPS = 0}, if \eqn{IPS-raw \le 0};
\item \eqn{IPS = [10 * (IPS-raw / 3)]}, if \eqn{0 < IPS-raw < 3};
\item \eqn{IPS = 10}, if \eqn{IPS-raw \ge 3}.
}
