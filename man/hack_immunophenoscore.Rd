\usage{
hack_immunophenoscore(expr_data, feature = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{expr_data}{A gene expression matrix (or data frame) with gene symbols as
row names and samples as columns.}

\item{feature}{A string indicating whether you want a more granular output (\code{type})
or a more aggregated one (\code{class}). Each of the two possible choices will give
the raw and discrete immunophenoscores.}
}
\value{
A data frame with
}
\description{
Obtain various immune biomarkers scores, which combined together give the
immunophenoscore (\emph{Charoentong et al., 2017}).
}
\details{
Immunophenoscore (IPS), is a score that was generated, through the use of machine learning, with The Cancer Genome Atlas data
from 20 solid cancers. The Cancer Immunome Atlas was generated (https://tcia.at/) by the depiction of intratumoral immune landscapes.
The score identifies the tumor immunogenicity, and it was able to predict the response to immunocheckpoint inhibitors
(anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies) in two validation cohorts.
